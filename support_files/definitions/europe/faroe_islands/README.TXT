* Delid 3:

Innleiðandi means qualifying round.
Endaspæl means bracket.

I confirmed that the qualifying round plays everyone twice:

And also in the bracket round you play everyone twice:

The qualifying round in the bygfoot schedule is correct, but I
couldn't find information about the bracket round schedule.
