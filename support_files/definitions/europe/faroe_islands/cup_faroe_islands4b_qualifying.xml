  <!-- last_week only gets generated when add_week == 1000, so we need to
       specify it here.  6 teams with 2 round robins = 10 matches.  We want
       to start in week 3, and there will be 2 breaks for the Faroe Islands
       cup in week 5 and 10, so the last week will be week 14.  However,
       the breaks are ignored when computing the start week, so we need
       to specify last week of 12 to get the actual last week to be 14.-->
