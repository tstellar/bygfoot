<!--
ideas
good delivery
brain fade
frustrating tackle
lost pateince 
plenty of room
little room
no words to describe this
frustration setting in
enthusiasm 
whipped the ball in 
once again team has failed to score
down he goes
whenever they attack they look like scoring
desperate to get a goal by half time
leading at half time gives team a phycoligical advantage
lethargic start
takes up a good position
accepts the ball from
team needs to address the amount of room they are giving team
player shows soem past tricks
player/teams pride is on the line here
stem the tide
team/player causing all the problems
knocks it onto player
its all doom andn gloom
shot forces a fine save from goalie
thas the worse 45 mins ive seen for a long time
points are in the bag
they have all the possesion but havnt produced
desperate times require desperate means
hard day at the office
plenty of chances out there
linning up for th eshot
keeper is a tough nut to crack
dangerous ball in to the box
teams been pulled apart this half
lteam in deep trouble
great first half performance
one way traffic out there , all teams way
oozing wiht confidance
converts from the spot
full credit
passionate play
team needed that save
picks out player
lack of comunication
throws caution to the wind
sent goalie the wrong way
goalie alert to the danger
goalie has been beaten ? times today
