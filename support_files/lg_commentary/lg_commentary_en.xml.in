stem the tide
team/player causing all the problems
knocks it onto player
its all doom and gloom
shot forces a fine save from goalie
that's the worse 45 minutes I've seen for a long time
points are in the bag
they have all the possesion but haven't produced
desperate times require desperate means
hard day at the office
plenty of chances out there
