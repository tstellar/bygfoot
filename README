DESCRIPTION

Bygfoot is a small and simple graphical football (a.k.a. soccer) manager game
featuring many international leagues and cups. You manage a team from one such
league: you form the team, buy and sell players, get promoted or relegated and
of course try to be successful.


INSTALLATION AND UPDATE

See INSTALL for instructions on how to install Bygfoot.

Have a look at UPDATE for instructions on how to keep your Bygfoot version
up-to-date easily.


BUG REPORTS AND PRAISE

If you like the game and have suggestions on how to improve it (keep in mind
that the game is kept simple on purpose, so don't suggest something like 'each
player should have separate skill-values for their right and left foot and you
should add the colour of their eye, too') or find bugs, write me to the above
address or submit a report on the website. You should describe the
circumstances of the occurence of the bug and whether you can reproduce it or
not. If there's an output, attaching it (unless it's a simple, hateful,
embarrassing segfault) might be helpful, too. If it's reproducible, it'd be
very helpful to attach a savegame.

Another way you can contribute to Bygfoot is to write a country file and send
me the result. See the forums at http://bygfoot.sourceforge.net/forum on help
and advice.
