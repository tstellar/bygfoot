DESCRIPTION

Bygfoot is a small and simple graphical football (a.k.a. soccer)
manager game featuring many international leagues and cups. You manage
a team from one such league: you form the team, buy and sell players,
get promoted or relegated and of course try to be successful.


INSTALLATION AND UPDATE

See INSTALL for instructions on how to install Bygfoot.

If you use the source package (bygfoot-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2), have a look at
UPDATE for instructions on how to keep your Bygfoot version up-to-date
without having to download new packages manually.


BUG REPORTS AND PRAISE

If you like the game and have suggestions on how to improve it (keep
in mind that the game is kept simple on purpose, so don't suggest
something like 'each player should have separate skill-values for
their right and left foot and you should add the colour of their eye,
too') or find bugs, write me to the above address or submit a report
on the website. You should describe the circumstances of the occurence
of the bug and whether you can reproduce it or not. If there's an
output, attaching it (unless it's a simple, hateful, embarrassing
segfault) might be helpful, too. If it's reproducible, it'd be very
helpful to attach a savegame.

Another way you can contribute to Bygfoot is to write a country file or edit
a team and send me the result. See the CUSTOMIZATION section in the Bygfoot
'Help' and the documentation at www.bygfoot.com.
