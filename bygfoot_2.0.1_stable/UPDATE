The bygfoot-update script is located in the 'b-u' directory of the source
package (1.8 branch) or in the build directory (1.9 branch). After installing
with 'make install' it will also be copied to PREFIX/bin, PREFIX mostly being
/usr/local.

The RPM package installs the script to /usr/bin.

For the binary package, the script is located in the bygfoot-X.Y.Z-binary
directory.

Call the script with the '-h' or '--help' switch to see command line options.

You can use the script to

- keep your source package up-to-date using patches
- download new releases
- download official country file names (1.8 branch)
- get a CVS version.
