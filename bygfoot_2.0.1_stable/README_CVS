This file tries to tell you how to use the CVS bygfoot-unstable versions.

1. If you'd just like to compile and play the game, you have to run
   './autogen.sh' in order to create the build files. Afterwards you can
   compile the package just like any other src package with make and make
   install. You'll need the following packages (as far as I know):
   - glib2
   - gtk+2
   - pango
   - atk
   - pkg-config
   - freetype2.

2. If you'd like to change the source code, but not the *interface* source
   files, you can do it without problems. Please send me patches if you've
   implemented interesting new features or corrected a bug.

3. Here's the trickiest part. The Bygfoot interface files are generated by
   Glade 2 from the *.glade files (which are in XML format). You can get it
   from http://glade.gnome.org. If you'd like to change a part of the
   interface, you have to:
   
   a) find out in which of the *.glade files the things you want to change
   are. For instance, if you'd like to change something in the options window,
   you'd have to use bygfoot_options.glade (ignore the *.gladep files).

   b) open the file with glade-2.

   c) edit the interface (by clicking around wildly with your mouse).

   d) save the changes and generate the *interface* files.

   d) recompile.

   I hope this works for you. If not, please contact me.
