	structure to the appropriate value
	- savegames located in the $HOME/.bygfoot/saves directory can be
	loaded from the command line without full path names

	without full path names
	- fixed a money bug: you can pay debts with your drawing
        credit now

	balanced until now)

	NOTE: This version is unfortunately not compatible anymore to
	saved games of previous versions. This is because of the new
	player and team names.

04/07/2004: v1.0 final 'Quickfoot'
	- connected the skill level of European teams to the average level
	of the Premiership so that it doesn't become too easy to win the
