	switched on and there were no games to play

	- added extended stadium capacity enlargement possibilities
	- added possibility to fire a player
	- added 'Player actions' button
	- changed the current skill and fitness display a bit: current

	(except for the home advantage factor); fitness can be 100% now
	and is shown in different colors (thanks to arnaudus)

	first one)

	- corrected a save/load bug that occurred when you saved a game
	just before getting a new scout

	NOTE: The 1.6 branch is not savegame-compatible to the 1.4.x

	first one)

08/17/2004: v1.4.3
	- corrected the '1-2'-bug: you couldn't enter these two digits
	into fields like the structure field because they were used as
	keyboard shortcuts for browsing forward and back. browsing's done
	with 'q' and 'w' now, and 'q' quits the game only when the browse
	buttons aren't shown (e.g. in main menu mode)

	long as the expected recovery time)

	savegame-compatible to 1.4.0. I'm terribly sorry.

	(e.g. participate in Champions' League only, without playing
	regular league games)
	- you can see information on your next opponents in the right part
	of the main window
	- swapping two players automatically adapts team structure (but
	you can switch this off, of course)
	- as you can see: the version numbering has changed. no

	- players are put onto the transfer list by right-clicking instead

	is in reality; utf8 seems to have disadvantages, too)
	- the 'Rearrange Team' button automatically changes the team
	structure to the appropriate value
	- savegames located in the $HOME/.bygfoot/saves directory can be
	loaded from the command line without full path names
	- country files located in one of the support files directories
	(e.g. $HOME/.bygfoot/text_files) can be loaded with '-f filename'
	without full path names
	- fixed a money bug: you can pay debts with your drawing
        credit now
	- introduced playing style for cpu-teams (they always played
	balanced until now)
	- added variable interest rates for your debts (the more you owe,
	the lower the interest rate)

	and league/cup names

	NOTE: This version is unfortunately not compatible anymore to
	saved games of previous versions. This is because of the new
	player and team names.

04/07/2004: v1.0 final 'Quickfoot'
	- connected the skill level of European teams to the average level
	of the Premiership so that it doesn't become too easy to win the
	European Cups after a couple of seasons

	- UEFA Cup is now harder to win
	- fixed a bug that led to the same number of goal chances in every
          game regardless of the individual teams that played (this made
	  it very hard for even the best teams to win predictably against
	  weaker opponents)
	- fixed a bug that allowed players to have a talent above 9.9
	- fixed a bug that caused the game to reject some normal save
	  files

	  to get healthy within a week
